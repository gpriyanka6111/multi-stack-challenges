## 👨‍💻 About This Journey

I'm coding **every single day**, building projects across **multiple tech stacks**. Each project is a learning adventure, and I'm documenting everything along the way!

### 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Code at least once every day
- ✅ Build functional projects, not just tutorials
- ✅ Learn multiple tech stacks through hands-on practice
- ✅ Document my journey and learnings
- ✅ Stay consistent and build momentum

---

## 📝 How This Works

### Folder Structure
Each project gets its own folder named by the day it started:
- `day-01-project-name/` - Project started on Day 1
- `day-05-another-project/` - Project started on Day 5

### Multi-Day Projects
If a project takes multiple days, I update its README daily:
- Day 1: Initial setup and basic features
- Day 2: Added more functionality
- Day 3: Final touches and completion

### Tech Stack Variety
I rotate between different technologies:
- Backend: Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, Java
- Frontend: React, Vue, Vanilla JS
- Mobile: React Native, Flutter
- Data: SQL, MongoDB, Redis
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes
- Fundamentals: Algorithms, Data Structures

## 🎯 My Coding Rules

1. ✅ **Code Every Day** - No exceptions, no matter how small
2. ✅ **Build Real Things** - Functional projects, not just tutorials
3. ✅ **Document Everything** - Day-by-day progress in each project
4. ✅ **Learn Multiple Stacks** - Don't stick to comfort zone
5. ✅ **Quality Over Speed** - Understand, don't just copy
6. ✅ **Share the Journey** - Make it public, help others learn
